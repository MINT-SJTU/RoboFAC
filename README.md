This is the official repo for our RoboFAC paper: "RoboFAC: A Comprehensive Framework for Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction".

## Introduction

RoboFAC is a comprehensive framework for robotic failure analysis and correction. 

- It provides a large-scale and diverse robotic failure QA dataset, covering a wide range of tasks, environments, and viewpoints. It includes eight QA types targeting different aspect of robotic failure understanding and correction.
- It proposes models for robotic failure video understanding, capable of comprehenive task understanding, failure analysis, and failure correction. 
- It includes a benchmark dataset for evaluating the failure understanding and correction performance of robotic failure correction models. 
- The model is integrated into a real-world robotic control pipeline as an external critic, enabling real-time correction for VLA-based systems.
